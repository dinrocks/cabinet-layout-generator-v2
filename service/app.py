"""ezdxf service — FastAPI. Two jobs only: DXF upload and DXF export.

Stateless w.r.t. layouts; touched ONLY on DXF up/download (SKILL.md §2). Phase 1
runs locally with no auth; Phase 2 will validate the Supabase token per request
and restrict CORS to the frontend domain (CLAUDE.md §5, SKILL.md §7 invariant 8).
